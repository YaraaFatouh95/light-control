# ğŸŒŸ Light Control System

## ğŸ“– Overview
The **Light Control System** is an IoT-based solution for managing and controlling lighting infrastructure across multiple cities and zones.  
It allows administrators to create and manage **cities**, **zones**, and **luminaires**, send **commands** to control lights, and schedule those commands through **Dkron** for automated execution.  
Commands are delivered to luminaires in real-time using the **MQTT** protocol.
